# System Architecture

The GoVote-IO system is built with a microservices architecture that prioritizes security, transparency, and reliability. This document provides an overview of the system's major components and how they interact.

## Core Services

The system is composed of the following core services:

### 1. Election Service
- **Repository**: [govote_election_service](https://github.com/GoVote-IO/govote_election_service)
- **Purpose**: Provides CRUD operations for creating and managing elections
- **Features**:
  - Election creation and configuration
  - Candidate management
  - Ballot design
  - Results publication

### 2. Authentication Service
- **Repository**: [govote_authentication_service](https://github.com/GoVote-IO/govote_authentication_service)
- **Purpose**: Handles authentication for voters, poll workers, and administrators
- **Features**:
  - Secure identity verification
  - Role-based access control
  - Two-factor authentication for administrators
  - Anonymous voting token generation

### 3. Voter Service
- **Repository**: [govote_voter_service](https://github.com/GoVote-IO/govote_voter_service)
- **Purpose**: Manages the voting process and records votes
- **Features**:
  - Ballot presentation
  - Vote recording
  - Receipt generation
  - Multi-cloud storage replication

## Data Flow

The voting process follows this general flow:

1. **Election Setup**: Administrators configure an election through the Election Service
2. **Voter Verification**: Voters are verified at polling locations via the Authentication Service
3. **Vote Casting**: Voters receive a secure, anonymous token to cast their vote via the Voter Service
4. **Vote Storage**: Votes are stored redundantly across multiple cloud providers
5. **Results Publication**: Once the election is closed, results are tallied and published

## Security Model

Security is built into every layer of the architecture:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data in transit is encrypted
- **Multi-Cloud Redundancy**: Vote data is replicated across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- **Identity Separation**: Voter identity verification is completely separated from vote casting
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring without compromising voter privacy
- **Geofencing**: Voting is restricted to authorized physical locations

## Deployment Models

GoVote-IO supports multiple deployment options:

1. **Cloud-Based SaaS**: Centrally managed solution for jurisdictions without IT infrastructure
2. **Self-Hosted**: Runs on local Kubernetes clusters for jurisdictions that prefer to manage their own infrastructure

Both models maintain identical security features and capabilities.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Go programming language with Goa framework
- **Data Storage**: Distributed database with multi-cloud replication
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- **Security**: TLS 1.3, multi-factor authentication, hardware security keys

## Future Architecture Enhancements

We have plans to extend the architecture with:

1. Advanced analytics capabilities
2. Support for additional voting methods (ranked choice, proportional)
3. Enhanced accessibility features
4. Additional language support beyond English and Spanish
