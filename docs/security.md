# Security Model

The GoVote-IO system is designed with security as a foundational principle. This document outlines our security model and the measures we've implemented to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the voting system.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

We implement multiple layers of security controls throughout the system so that if one layer fails, others remain intact:

- Application-level security
- Transport-level encryption
- Network segmentation
- Physical security requirements for deployments
- Multi-cloud redundancy

### 2. Privacy by Design

Voter privacy is protected through:

- Complete separation of voter identity from vote choices
- Anonymous cryptographic tokens for ballot access
- No persistent correlation between voter and their selections

### 3. Transparency

Security through obscurity is rejected in favor of:

- Fully open-source codebase
- Published security architecture
- Public vulnerability disclosure process
- Independent security audits

## Technical Security Features

### End-to-End Encryption

- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3
- All sensitive data at rest is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
- Key management follows best practices for rotation and protection

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- Election administrators require hardware security keys
- Poll workers use a combination of credentials and one-time codes
- Critical operations require multiple authentication factors

### Multi-Cloud Redundancy

Vote data is stored redundantly across:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform

This approach ensures:
- No single cloud provider has complete control over election data
- Results can be independently verified across providers
- Service continuity even if one provider experiences an outage

### Geofenced Voting

- Voting is restricted to authorized physical locations
- Location verification is required before ballot access
- Anomalous access attempts are flagged and investigated

## Audit and Verification

### Vote Verification

- Voters receive a cryptographic receipt hash that can be used to verify their vote was recorded
- The verification process never reveals the contents of the vote, preserving ballot secrecy

### System Auditing

- Comprehensive audit logging of all system activities
- Independent verification of election results
- Automated integrity checking between cloud providers
- CLI-based audit tools for election officials and observers

### Paper Backup

- Paper ballot printing is available for jurisdictions requiring physical records
- Paper records can be used for recounts and audits

## Security Testing and Review

The GoVote-IO system undergoes:

1. Regular security code reviews
2. Static and dynamic application security testing
3. Penetration testing before major releases
4. Bug bounty programs to incentivize responsible disclosure

## Incident Response

We maintain a comprehensive incident response plan that includes:

1. Monitoring and detection systems
2. Established response procedures
3. Forensic investigation capabilities
4. Transparent disclosure protocols
