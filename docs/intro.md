# Welcome to GoVote-IO

GoVote-IO is an open-source voting system initiative created in response to electronic voting concerns in recent elections. Our mission is to build a transparent, auditable, and secure electronic voting system that can restore trust in democratic processes.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a transparent, auditable voting system using the Go programming language and the Goa framework. The entire system is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0) to ensure public auditability and prevent closed-source modifications.

### Core Values

1. **Transparency** - Every line of code is open to public scrutiny
2. **Security** - Military-grade security with multi-cloud redundancy
3. **Accessibility** - Designed to be usable by all voters, regardless of ability
4. **Auditability** - Full audit trails and verification capabilities

## System Components

The GoVote-IO system consists of multiple interconnected services:

1. **Election Service**: For creating and managing elections
2. **Authentication Service**: For securely identifying voters, poll workers, and administrators
3. **Voter Service**: For ballot presentation and vote recording
4. **Election Language**: Specification for defining ballots and elections

## Getting Started

There are several ways to get involved with the GoVote-IO project:

### For Developers

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GoVote-IO/govote-io.github.io.git

# View other repositories in the organization
gh repo list GoVote-IO
```

Check out our [architecture document](./architecture.md) and [security model](./security.md) to understand how the system works.

### For Election Officials

We're building GoVote-IO to meet the needs of election administrators. If you're interested in piloting or providing feedback on the system, please [contact us](https://github.com/GoVote-IO/govote-io.github.io/discussions) or open a discussion on GitHub.

### For Voters and the General Public

The entire codebase is available for public review. We welcome questions, suggestions, and feedback through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/GoVote-IO/govote-io.github.io/discussions).

## Project Status

GoVote-IO is currently in the early stages of development. We're focusing on:

1. Defining the system architecture
2. Building the core services
3. Creating comprehensive documentation
4. Establishing security protocols
