  - Support for lightweight K3s for small deployments
  - Terraform for infrastructure as code
  - Multi-cloud deployment capability

- **Security & Monitoring**:
  - Alternative to HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
  - Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
  - ELK or Grafana Loki for log management

- **DevOps**:
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Renovate for dependency management
  - Docker for containerization

## Architecture Principles

### Service Communication
- Internal communication via mutual TLS-encrypted channels
- JWT-based authentication between services
- Network policies restricting service-to-service communication
- Zero-trust networking between components
- Minimize external traffic; keep sensitive operations internal
- Support for small Kubernetes deployments (self-hosted)

### Data Management
- Service-specific databases (database-per-service)
- Clear data ownership boundaries
- Schema versioning and migration management
- Audit logging at the database level

### Geographic Distribution
- Support for precinct, county, state, and federal levels
- Strong isolation between geographic entities
- Hierarchical roll-up for reporting
- Jurisdiction-specific configuration and customization

## Security Framework

### Authentication
- FIDO2/WebAuthn with hardware security keys for officials
- Federated authentication model per jurisdiction
- No global user database to prevent single point of failure
- Anonymous credential issuance for voters after in-person verification
- Location-bound authentication for voting

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Data-at-rest encryption for all persistent storage
- Modern cryptographic libraries with regular security audits
- Key rotation procedures

### Vote Integrity
- Triplicate storage across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Independent, queued transactions for each cloud destination
- PDF format with embedded cryptographic signatures
- SHA-256 hash generation for each ballot
- Cross-cloud hash verification via `audit sha` tool

### Geolocation Security
- US-only traffic filtering
- Precinct-level geofencing for voting endpoints
- IP allowlisting by precinct
- Token-based authorization with precinct identifiers

### Audit and Monitoring
- Dedicated real-time audit microservice
- Half-hourly comprehensive audit cycle during voting
- Cross-cloud ballot existence verification
- Alert system for discrepancies
- Tiered alerting based on severity

## Resilience and Availability

### Redundancy
- N+1 minimum for all critical components
- Multi-cloud storage with independent transactions
- Active-active configuration where possible
- Detailed architecture documents for self-hosted deployments

### Data Protection
- Hourly point-in-time snapshots in immutable storage
- Write-ahead logs shipped to secure offsite storage
- Database deletion protection requiring multi-party authorization
- Multi-region backup distribution

### Network Resilience
- Redundant network paths
- Local network resilience for polling locations
- Local caching servers where feasible
- UPS for critical components

## Scalability

### Scaling Approach
- Horizontal scaling through microservices
- Vertical scaling capabilities for different jurisdiction sizes
- Critical path optimization for vote casting (real-time)
- Asynchronous processing for non-voter-facing operations
- Queue-based workload distribution for background tasks

### Performance Research
- Analysis of US voting patterns for capacity planning
- Synthetic load testing based on real-world patterns
- Performance testing across various network conditions
- Hardware constraint modeling for self-hosted deployments

## Development Standards

### API Design
- Goa-based design-first approach
- Strong typing for all inputs and outputs
- Explicit validation rules
- Versioning strategy
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Code Quality
- Code coverage minimum of 85%
- Static analysis with configurable rule sets
- AI-assisted code review (Code-rabbit, GitHub Copilot)
- Security-focused review for critical components

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests with high code coverage
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end web-based testing
- Performance testing with k6
- Security-focused penetration testing
- Red team exercises simulating sophisticated attacks

### Technical Debt Management
- Dedicated tracking system
- Regular code quality scanning
- Risk-based assessment and prioritization
- Scheduled refactoring initiatives

## Deployment and Operations

### Deployment Models
- Cloud-native deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- On-premises deployment with lightweight Kubernetes
- Hybrid options with secure connectivity
- Air-gapped deployment capabilities

### Upgrade Management
- Blackout periods prohibiting updates during elections
- Emergency patch process requiring multi-factor authorization
- Immutable infrastructure approach for clean upgrades
- Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates

### Monitoring Strategy
- Technical monitoring for IT staff
- Operational monitoring for election officials
- Executive dashboards with simplified indicators
- Alert design appropriate for technical and non-technical users

## Important Guidelines
1. Security must be the paramount consideration in all design decisions
2. Design for auditability and transparency at every level
3. Support deployment models from cloud to small self-hosted environments
4. Maintain compatibility with typical county IT resource constraints
5. Implement strong isolation between geographic/jurisdictional boundaries
6. Document all technical decisions with clear rationales
7. Design systems to be resilient against sophisticated attacks
8. Avoid political influence - no involvement from politicians or lobbyists
9. Keep the architecture as simple as possible while meeting security requirements
10. Design for long-term maintenance and evolution

As CTO/Chief Architect, your focus should be on creating a secure, scalable, and auditable system that can be trusted by voters, election officials, and security experts alike, while maintaining the practical deployability needed for widespread adoption.
